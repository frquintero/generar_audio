# Project Plan: Text-to-Speech Audio Generator

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a Node.js script that utilizes the Vercel AI SDK to generate speech audio from text using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini-TTS model. The script produces an MP3 file with narration in a user-specified language and style determined at runtime. The goal is to deliver a flexible, cost-effective text-to-speech tool with clear configuration, error handling, and user-friendly output.

Key features:
- Uses experimental_generateSpeech API from Vercel AI SDK
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini-TTS model for high-quality audio
- Runtime-configurable language and narration style
- Outputs to MP3 file format
- OpenAI API key retrieved from global environment variables

## Phases and Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Install required dependencies (Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI SDK)
- Set up project directory structure
- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in global environment variables
- Initialize package.json with necessary scripts

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Implement the audio generation function using experimental_generateSpeech
- Configure the OpenAI speech model with appropriate parameters
- Add command-line interface for user input (text, language, style)
- Implement dynamic voice instructions based on user-selected language and style
- Implement file writing to output.mp3
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- Test script execution with valid API credentials
- Verify audio output quality and file format
- Test error scenarios (invalid API key, network issues, invalid inputs)
- Validate narration accuracy across different languages and styles

### Phase 4: Refinement and Documentation
- Add input validation for text, language, and style parameters
- Implement configurable output file names and paths
- Refine command-line interface with help options and prompts
- Add progress indicators and user feedback
- Create README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Optimize for performance and reliability

### Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Package the script for easy distribution
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Update dependencies as needed for compatibility
